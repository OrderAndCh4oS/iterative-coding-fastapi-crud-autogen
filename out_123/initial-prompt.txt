We're building a RESTful API for managing customer data. 
Customers will have uuid, email, username, createdAt, updatedAt fields.
We will update an sqlite3 db on create, update and delete requests.
We will use Fastapi, Pydantic and unittest.
You will use Black for linting the project
We will handle POST and GET requests to /customer and GET, PUT, DELETE /customer/:uuid requests.
We must make sure the fastapi app has all of the routes defined correctly.

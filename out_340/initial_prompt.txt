Write A RESTful API for managing product data:
It will use Fastapi for the app, Pydantic for validation and unittest for testing.
It will have an in-memory db with wrapper functions to query the database.
It will have a Products table with uuid (string), name, description, createdAt, updatedAt columns.
Each product must have getDetail, getList, createOne, updateOne, deleteOne request handlers.
It must define each products request handlers, unit tests and data models etc. in separate files. eg product_handlers.py, product_tests.py, product_models.py.
It will use separate Pydantic classes for the stored products, any requests and responses. For example Product, CreateProductRequest, UpdateProductRequest, ProductResponse.

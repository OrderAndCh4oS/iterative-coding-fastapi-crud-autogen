We're building a RESTful API for managing customer data. 
We will handle POST and GET requests to /customer and GET, PUT, DELETE /customer/:uuid requests.
Customers will have uuid, email, username, createdAt, updatedAt fields.
We will write all of the tests for each endpoint before we write the handlers.
We must test the body response data before we test http status codes in unit tests, this is vitally important.
We will run tests the tests individually as we go to prove the api works as expected.
We must prove the api endpoint works by running our unittest testing suite. 
We will use Fastapi, unittest and uuidv7 time-ordered UUID. 
We will update an in-memory db on create, update and delete requests.
We must never run the server directly, this is very important. 
We must make sure the fastapi app has all of the routes defined correctly.
We must not create a venv or any other virtual environment.
Start by planning the application step by step, then implement each step.

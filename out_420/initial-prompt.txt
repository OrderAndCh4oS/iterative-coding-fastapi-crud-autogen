We're building a RESTful API for managing customer data. 
Customers will have uuid, email, username, createdAt, updatedAt fields.
We will update an in-memory db on create, update and delete requests.
We will use Fastapi, unittest and uuidv7 time-ordered UUID.
We will handle POST and GET requests to /customer and GET, PUT, DELETE /customer/:uuid requests.
We must make sure the fastapi app has all of the routes defined correctly.
